============

Here is a list of the dependencies this module requires to run.

- Django 1.2
- `Django Content type framework`_
- `celery`_ - task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing

*Note: The content types framework is already included and enabled by default in all the Django projects created using the startproject management comment, so you most likely won't need to change anything.*
